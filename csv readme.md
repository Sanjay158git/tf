    import os 
    import time 
    import chardet 
    import csv

The above lines are import statements that import necessary libraries. os library provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system. time library is used for measuring the execution time of the program. chardet library detects the character encoding of a file. csv library provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.
 
  start_time = time.time()

This line creates a variable called start_time and assigns it the value of the current time in seconds since the epoch.
 
  directory_path = ''

This line creates a variable called directory_path and assigns it a string that represents the path to a directory where the program will search for files containing the specified keywords.

    keywords = ['sampletest', 'cat', 'Twitch']

This line creates a variable called keywords and assigns it a list of strings representing the keywords that the program will search for in the files.
     num_files = 0 results = [] header = ['File Path', 'Keyword Found']

These lines create variables num_files, results, and header. num_files will store the number of files that contain at least one keyword, results will store the file path and keyword of the files that contain at least one keyword, and header is a list of strings representing the column headers of the CSV file that will be generated.

These lines search for the specified keywords in all files within the specified directory path. The os.walk function returns a generator that generates tuples of (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) for each directory it encounters while traversing the file system hierarchy. The for loop iterates over each file in the filenames list for each directory, and constructs the full file path by joining the dirpath and file_name using the os.path.join function. The with open(...) statement opens the file in binary mode, reads the contents of the file, and uses chardet.detect to determine the character encoding of the file. The encodings_to_try variable contains a list of character encodings to try in case the detected encoding fails to decode the file contents. The try-except block attempts to open the file in each encoding until the file contents can be decoded successfully. If the file contents can be decoded successfully, the for loop iterates over each keyword in the keywords list and checks if the keyword is present in the file contents. If the keyword is present, the file
